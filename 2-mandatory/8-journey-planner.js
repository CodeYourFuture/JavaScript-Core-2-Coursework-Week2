/*
  This exercise was also in JS1 week 4, but you didn't know about objects yet.
  It's more clear with objects than with arrays!
  Feel free to look at your solution to that one to help you out - you already did this once!
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Write a function journeyPlanner that:
  - Accepts two paramters:
    1) An object where the keys are locations and the values are arrays of the transportation modes you can use to get there.
       e.g.
       {
           Angel: ["tube", "bus"],
           "London Bridge": ["tube", "river boat"],
       }
    2) A string containing a transport mode
       e.g. "bus"
  - Returns an array of where I can go if I only want to use a specific mode of transport.
  NOTE: Only the location names should be returned, as strings.
  When you finish the exercise, think about how this solution is different to your last solution.
  What's better about each approach?
*/

function journeyPlanner(locations, transportMode) {
  let canTravelTo = [];
  for (key in locations) {
    let location = key;
    if (locations[location].includes(transportMode)) canTravelTo.push(location);
  }

  return canTravelTo;
}
