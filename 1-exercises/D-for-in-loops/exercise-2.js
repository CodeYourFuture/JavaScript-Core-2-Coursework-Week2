   The "shapes" object contains keys of various shapes, with
   the number of sides they have as their value.

   Use a "for...in" loop to construct an array of shapes which have
   5 or more sides. This array has already been declared for you
   ("shapesWithMoreThanFiveSides").

   Note, you also will need to make use of some array methods you have seen
   previously.
